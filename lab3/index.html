	<h1> Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer <h1>

		<h2> Objective </h2>

			<p> The objective/goal of this lab was to teach students how to create links that link to other pages they have the URL to.</p>
		<h3>Difficulties Encountered</h3>

			<p>Mainly figuring out what exactly to put in the link, since at first I put art101/lab__ when I should have just put lab__. I realized this mistake when I looked at the URL and saw that it was registering as art101/art101/lab__.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>

			<p>The results were me learning how to better read and write the links and URLs needed to get to the right places and such. Here is how I wrote my code for this page.</p>
