    <h1>Challenges</h1>

      <p>The challenge of this lab was to help the students understand how loops work in javascript and how to properly execute a loop.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>

      <p>We are having a lot of trouble with printing out the loop into the html itslef. We aren't too sure what we can do about this and don't know how to fix it. Using the strings and trying to follow the example code kind of went over our heads. We're hoping to meet with the professor and talk to him about this.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>

      <p>Unfortunetly, for now you will have to 'inspect' the page and then open the console to see the work being done.</p>
