    <h1>Challenges</h1>

      <p>I! Am very!! Confused!!! I think I made an entire website when I wasn't supposed to? I'm not sure, I hope I remember to link this up in my art101 index.html website because it is currently tomorrow and I am  t i r e d.</p>
      <p>Also understanding js without... I guess prior knowledge? I didn't understand the language they were using though that could also be part of the whole 'it's after 10pm which means my brain no longer understands anything' but who knows honestly.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>

      <p>Lots! Of problems!!</p>
      <p>Honestly it was mainly just getting me and my partner to meet up at the same time. We were only able to meet/sit down and work together the night before all this was due, and now I'm hungry but the dining hall closed so I'm sad.</p>
      <p>Registering and understanding what I was doing wrong is also another problem I'm having when it comes to the js file.</p>

        <li>A website I do not need, but I think looks nice.</li>
