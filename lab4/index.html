			<li>Ingredients Needed</li>

			<ul>
				<li>1 1/4 C unbleached all-purpose flour or milled wheat berries</li>
				<li>1 C clean warm water</li>
				<li>1 sterile jar with cheesecloth or lid</li>

			</ul>
			<li>Instructions</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Mix the flour and warm water, and keep it at room temperature.</li>
				<li>After several days, the mixture will start to bubble and will begin to rise.</li>
				<li>Keep your starter in the refrigerator when not in use. Use as you would any sourdough starter.</li>

			</ul>
			<li>Feed the yeast</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Add 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water <strong>daily</strong> if it is at room temperature and <strong>weekly</strong> if it is in the fridge.</li>
				<li>If you donâ€™t bake bread that day, you will also need to toss out one cup of the starter after feeding so that the ratios stay the same.</li>

			</ul>
