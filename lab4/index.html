		<li>Make Sourdough Bread</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Ingredients Needed</li>

				<ul>
					<li>5.35 oz of active sourdough starter</li>
					<li>8.80 oz warm water</li>
					<li>0.90 oz olive oil</li>
					<li>17.65 oz bread flour (<strong>not</strong> all purpose flour)</li>
					<li>0.40 oz fine sea salt</li>
					<li>Fine ground conrmeal, for dusting</li>

				</ul>
			<li>Instructions</li>

				<ol>
					<li>Make the dough</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Whisk together the starter, water, and olive oil in a large bowl.</li>
						<li>Add he flour and salt.</li>
						<li>Squish together with your hands until all the flour has been absorbed.</li>
						<li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or very damp kitchen towel.</li>
						<li>Let rest from 30 minutes up to 1 hour.</li>
						<li>Work the dough into a rough ball for about 15 seconds.</li>

					</ol>
					<li>Bulk Rise</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Cover the bowl with wrap or a very damp kitchen towel.</li>
						<li>Let rest in a warm spot to rise for 3-12 hours or until it has doubled in size.</li>
						<li><strong>Optional</strong>: Start 30 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about an hour apart. This will increase the total volume and height of your bread.</li>

					</ol>
					<li>Cut and Shape the Dough</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping).</li>
						<li>Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it.</li>
						<li>Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf.</li>
						<li>To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle.</li>
						<li>Flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance.</li>

					</ol>
					<li>Second Rise</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Place dough inside oven for 30 minutes to 1 hour and cover with the lid of a pot or very damp cloth. The dough is ready when it is slightly puffy but <strong>not</strong> double in size.</li>
						<li>Preheat your oven to 450º F towards the tail end of the second rise.</li>

					</ol>
					<li>Score the Dough<li>

					<ul>
						<li>Cuts should be about 2-3 inches long and 1/4 inch deep.</li>

					</ul>
					<li>Bake the Dough</li>

					<ol>
						<li>Place he bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on).</li>
						<li>Reduce temperature to 400 F.</li>
						<li>Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
						<li>Remove the lid and continue to bake for 40 minutes <em>or</em> until depp, golden brown.</li>
						<li>Check internal temperature of bread, should be 205-210 F.</li>
						<li>Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.</li>

					</ol>
