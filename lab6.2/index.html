    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenge of this lab was to teach the student how to work with javascript on a browser console and how to properly use arrays and objects. It was also so students could understand how declare a function, declare a variable, how to make an output the desirable one, and to remind the students of the importance of organization and cleanliness when writing code.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>This is my second time doing this lab, and this time without a partner. It went slightly faster because I already knew what to do but I re did this lab in an effort to try and understand what I was doing wrong/not understanding. I still have lots of questions and have written them down to ask my professor at a later date.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>What you see here is the results of my solo second attempt at this lab. Unable to fully grasp the point of some of the things I was told to write, I wrote them but did not understand them. My website works, but only because I had a specific guidline to follow.<p/>
