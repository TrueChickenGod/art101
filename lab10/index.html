    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenges presented to us here were too make a button that, when clicked, would take the inputted name and give it back in alphabetical order.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>We unintentionally had one main problem due to Ramola's sad attempt at fixing a broken code by adding 'form' to the code when it doesn't work. Other than that our code actually worked just fine but <em>noooOOoooOooOOo</em> we <em>had</em> to add something else.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>What you see below is the results of our days of agonizing efforts.</p>
      <p id="help">
          <label for="user-name">Username:</label><br>
          <input type="text" id="user-name">
          <button id="my-button"> Click me! </button>
