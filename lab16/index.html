    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenge of this lab was to have the students get some information from the API endpoint and have it be pushed to the output div for the desired results.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>Initially we couldn't get the API endpooint to work, it would show u and have a certain error with no way to fix it. We fixed this by making the endpoint the json infromation rather than the image itself.</p>
