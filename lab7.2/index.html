    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenge/point of this lab was to have the studentss create a funtion that would take the users inputted username and give it back sorted alphabetically.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>The problems we encountered were the fact that we didn't quite understand how the example got to where it was. How would someone know to write the code that they did? We were very confused about that at first but later one understood it after looking at the code closer.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>The resulting page is this one here; one that asks you for your username and gives it back alphabetically sorted! This is our code here:</p>
