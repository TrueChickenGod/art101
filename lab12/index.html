    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challnge of Lab 12 was to have the students create and understand how to use conditionals in the form of making a very basic Hogwarts sorting conditional that sorted the user based on how many characters they had in the name submitted (up to 4).</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>The problems we faced were simple in nature. We originally tried to use both jQuery and regular JavaScript in the JavaScript file but doing so returned an error. We then switched to just good old fashioned JavaScript and that fixed the problem.</p>
      <p>We then ran into an issue of the button only returning 'Gryffindor' no matter how many characters we put into the submission. We fixed this issue by changing the words in JavaScript to the full words instead of the short hand (i.e. we changed 'len' into 'length' and 'mod' into 'modulus'), and that fixed the problem!</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>Below are the results; enter a word or name between 0 and 3 characters and you will get sorted into one of the four houses!</p>
