    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p> The challenge of this lab was to have the students create a website with some DOM manipulation elements.
      </p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p> WOW we had a <em>big</em> problem. There weren't a lot of problems but we had a couple big ones that just... ruined our day.
      </p>
      <p> First off, when we pushed our code it kept showing up as an error. For the longest time we couldn't figure out what was wrong but when we spoke to Leslie she pointed out that we hadn't put the 'document.' in front of the getElement part of the code. From there the error wass that the site couldn't read the append child. We worried over it for days and when we finally were able to get office hours and talk to Wes, it turns out the only problem was the fact that we had forgotten to put the 'defer' after the src="js/lab.js" in the script in the head.
      </p>
      <p> When we saw that was the one thing we were missing, we were more than a little peeved, but have now learned our lesson. Here's hoping lab10 will be something we can understand a little better!
      </p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p> The results are below; we were able to have the DOM return the words 'Random' and 'Again' as we wanted!
