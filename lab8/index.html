    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The challenge for this lab was to have the student make a function that did <em>math!</em></p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>We didn't run into too many problems during this lab mainly because Ramola took control of the math part because Kiyo heard the word 'math' and had a heart attack. I (Ramola) find math really fun once I understand it though so I was happy as a clam! I just hope that what I did was good enough for the lab!</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>Check the console out for the javascript! It's really fun!</p>
