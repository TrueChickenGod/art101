      <p>The challenge of this lab was to have the students experiment and make things with jQuery.</p>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>Right off the bat we were feeling a little overwhelmed because jQuery looked like a whole new language. At the same time, it seemed like it was bordering on being a little <em>too</em> easy considering all the headaches we've experienced so far. We seemed to run into a small issue where clicking one 'hide' button ended up hiding <em>everything.</em></p>
      <p>What we ended up doing was move some things around and have the buttons and headings be outside the divs as well as adding seperate Id's to each button. It seems to have worked so far which is surprising considering how much trouble we've had with the past labs so far! Ramola's just hoping that this keeps up.</p>
