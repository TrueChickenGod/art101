		<h1> Welcome To: The Chicken's Coop</h1>

		<p>Truly being unable to focus and imprint information into ones head is a curse unlike most can see. When it's hot I get exceedingly tired, when it's time for classes my body melts into a mushy state of dissary. I can't help but be a dissapointment to both myself and others. Perhaps the simple act of sleeping would help but unable to do so there is no way for me to even know what I'm talking about. Did you know that one can look at neither the screen nor the keyboard in order to figure out what I am typing is indeed correct. The unfortunate situations of being so easily overhwlemed will tear your brain apart at the seams. You want to scream at someone to shut up despite the social ramifications because everything is just too much for you right now. Even the clicking of keys under your fingertips as you type threatens to dig into your skull and leave gaping holes whre knowledge once was or could have been. There is no need to be intelligent to know what this rambling of nonsense is about. This is simply a stream of conciousness of a child who could never be a child and of someone who cannot see where his or her life is heading because their only refuge is within the confines of their own mind and yet even that is falling apart.

		<p> ON ANOTHER NOTE I have no idea what I'm doing, but I DO know that I want italics, bolds, which I can do I guess but I just want that for one word, it's pretty cool how I don't have to look at the keyboard 24/7 to type half the time. ANYWAY oops no wrap text L M A O I need so much help. So, so, so much help. </p>
